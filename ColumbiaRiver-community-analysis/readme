In this activity, students are provided with relative abundance data of bacterial and archaeal communities; they are guided through visualizing the data and answering some basic questions interpreting their results.

The dataset used in this activity includes 16S rRNA gene relative abundance data generated by two iterations of the Microbial Ecology course at Lewis & Clark College. The spring 2022 dataset includes two samples from the Columbia River and one from the Willamette River; the fall 2023 dataset includes one sample each from the Columbia, Willamette, and Sandy Rivers.

Students were provided with the QCed relative abundance data, R scripts for possible analyses, and a series of questions to answer as a lab report. This activity assumes prior experience with analyzing multivariate data in vegan and phyloseq; it was written for class use in posit.cloud.
