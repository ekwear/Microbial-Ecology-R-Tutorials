# Microbial-Ecology-R-Tutorials
An archive of R tutorials developed for Microbial Ecology, an undergraduate course at Lewis &amp; Clark College

This repository includes two laboratory activities that have been used in an undergraduate course in Microbial Ecology. The first is a tutorial that uses published data to teach students methods of community-level data visualization using the R packages vegan and phyloseq. The second activity has students visualize features of bacterial and archaeal community composition using data that their class generated from sites in the Columbia River watershed.
